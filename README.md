# Meade_et_al_BXD_TnSeq
All the raw phenotype and genotype files for QTL mapping in the BXD TnSeq screen for use in R/qtl2.

This repository contains supplemental data from Meade et al., 2022 (Online Ahead of Print). 

Publication URL: [UPDATE]

DOI: [UPDATE]

Files: 

BXD_covar_rqtl2.csv - additive covariates

BXD_genotypes_rqtl2.csv - BXD mouse genotypes

BXD_gmap_rqtl2.csv - genetic map (cM)

BXD_pheno_rqtl2.csv - clinical phenotypes and TnSeq mutant fitness profiles by BXD genotype; Mtb genes with less than 4 transposon insertions represented were excluded. Additionally, Mtb genes with less than 0.63 log2 fold change across the BXD tested genotypes were excluded for mapping.

BXD_pmap_rqtl2.csv - physical map (Mb)

BXD.yaml - cross object for data entry into R/qtl2
